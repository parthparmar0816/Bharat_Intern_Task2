Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression

Machine learning model to predict the quality of Wine using linear regression only.

For this problem we will be Red Wine Quality Data,The datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].

Here our data due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). Our machine learning model must predict the Quality of Wine.
